# SportsToday

Welcome to SportsToday, the interactive CLI-APP that allows you to stay intune with your favorite sports.  As we know, sports are played around the world, and many are televised.
What SportsToday sets out to do is let the user pick their favorite sport through a menu and return, if possible, all the events that fall under that category.  We will show you
matchups, the description of the event, and when the event will be televised, as well as what network it will be televised on.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sports_today'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sports_today

## Usage

To use, simply install the program and run it.  You will start out at a menu screen and from there, you can choose the sport you would like to get more information on.
